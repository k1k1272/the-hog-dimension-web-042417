# The Hog Dimension

The Hogwarts application was incredible. It instilled in us a burning compulsion to create more hog oriented experiences. We have no choice but to satiate our new obsession! For the most part, this is a fully fleshed out application with both a back end server (a rails API), as well as a client (a react web app). Our goal here is to, given a list of deliverables, navigate the existing code base and implement several new features on both the server as well as the client.

When 'out in the field', we will be spending a significant amount of our time working on existing code bases. As you have experienced, code can have wildly different writing styles. While some pre-existing structures may click with us, others seem alien.

If you jump right in to the React client with the intention of implementing the deliverables before familiarizing yourself with the code, you may find yourself writing sub-optimal solutions. This could manifest in you introducing unintended side-effects/bugs to the existing application or in you re-implementing a solution that has already been mostly created in a separate file.

Take a moment digesting the structure in context of the features we want to implement before making changes. Our goal here is to be like surgeons: we want to blend the new features in with the existing structure quickly and effectively. In order to do this, we will assume the colloquialism: "Measure twice, cut once", or as the long winded programming alternative goes: "Architect twice, fix errors still, but half as many". After all, we want to complete this as soon as possible so the world can have our hogsperience.

You will find a README.md in both the client and server directories describing deliverables for each.
Our server's seed data (porkers_data.json) is located in this directory.
While it is entirely up to you in what order you complete this lab, I would recommend starting with the client deliverables. They may help inform you of the role the back end should play.
